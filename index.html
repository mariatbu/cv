                  <p class="text-prof">I am a 23 year old telecommunication engineer by the Politecnical University of Cartagena, in Murcia. Despite the fact that I have always loved microwaves, antennas and signal processing, one of my other passions is programming. Being able to make my own websites and programms in order to help others is the most satisfying feeling of being a developer. I also appreciate the fact of being part of a huge community of other programmers where constant learning is almost like a lifestyle.</p>

                    <p class="coding-text">I started becoming interested in coding when I was very small.  As I have grown up I have started to learn different programming lenguages and now I am looking forward to becomming a professional web developer.
                      During my academic life I've had the pleasure to learn the following lenguages: Java, MATLAB, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, node.js, AngularJS and SQL. Of course, I still have a long way to meet my goals.</p>

                    <p class="english-text">I've always considered that talking to people and trying to understand them is the best way to learn and grow up as a professional and as a person. Those are the main reasons why I tend to take care about personal relationships with collegues and friends and I am willing to meet new people. Most of the time, especially in a professsional career, those relationships arise between people from different countries, that's why I consider English so important.</p>
                    <p class="english-text">But not only English is important, but also your values and actions. So above all, humility, honesty and kindness are some of my principles.</p>
